This tells the code: we already have a dictionary, and now we are going to add (NOT overwrite) some keys and corresponding values. Our dictionary is empty, of course, so why do we need to use `.update`? To answer that, you need to understand how the computer thinks about for loops. It is literally looping through the same code, in order, over and over again. So, the first time the code executes your for loop, it writes some key and some value to your empty dictionary. The second time it executes your for loop, the dictionary is no longer empty. Because of this, we use the `.update` function. If we didn't, our dictionary would overwrite itself with new values each time it went through the for loop, and you would end up with a dictionary with only one key and one value.\n",

So, the code will expect a sequence like key: value. `key`: this is the thing that is changing each time we go through our for loop. We are looping in terms of `key` and `value` (`for key, value in`...). That means, that on the first loop, the variable `key` corresponds to the first key in the MAS_12 dictionary (that'd be \"SiO2\"). The second time through the loop, `key` corresponds to the second key in the MAS_12 dictionary (that'd be \"TiO2\"). And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that you can grab any element of a dictionary by typing `dictionary_name[key]` as you did above when you printed the FeO value for MAS_12. That's what the rest of this line of code means.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize:\n",
    "- `MAS_12_MPO.update()`: add new values to our dictionary, and don't overwrite old ones\n",
    "- `key`: we are adding a key whose name is the value of the nth key in MAS_12, where n=loop number\n",
    "- `MAS_12[key]`: the value of our key will be the nth value in the MAS_12 dictionary\n",
    "- `molecular_weights[key]`: then divide the value of `MAS_12[key]` by the nth value in the molecular_weights dictionary\n",

    "Currently, our mole fraction dictionary MAS_12_X sums to (1 + XH$_2$O). We need some mathematical operation to normalize the major oxides (everything except H$_2$O) to a sum of (1 - XH$_2$O) so that the sum of all oxides (including H$_2$O) sums to 1 exactly. We can accomplish this by applying the conversion of the Maclaurin series expansion, 1 + x + x$^2$ + X$^3$ + ..., which converges to 1/(1-x), to the major oxides. Here, our x value is the mole fraction of H$_2$O, and we need to divide the mole fraction value of each major oxide by 1/(1-x). \n",
